# slot-spike

A spike for Fluent UI vNext slots

The goal is to compare the capabilities of two approaches:

- Fluent UI vNext attribute-based slots
- slots provided through props.children

to help these RFCS:

- [RFC: update slots API to allow arrays](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/pull/19266)
- [Field label approaches](https://hackmd.io/GQJtwlWnRpaT56yOLGBKhA)

## Stories

### Capabilities

- I can slot an only child, named child/children, list, or hierarchy of content.
- I can read the props of slotted content.
- I can modify the rendering (order, arrangement) of content.
- I can modify the props of slotted content.
- I can modify the classes/style of slotted content.
- I can subscribe to an event from slotted content (wrap to leave child event intact)

### Types of slot content

- I can slot primitive values.
- I can slot HTML elements.
- I can slot JSX.
- I can slot render functions.
- I can slot props //applies only to the attributes approach
- I can slot a heterogeneous list/hierarchy of children. //may only apply to props.children approach

### Types of children

- I can slot a single child as content.
- I can slot a list of children as content.
- I can slot a hiearchy of children.

## Findings

- There aren't any technical limitations to the attributes or props.children approaches.
- Both approaches require about the same amount of helper code to navigate and manipulate slotted content.
- Even with strong typing, both approaches require the component to validate slotted content at runtime.

**The props.children approach**

- provides a complete hierarchy for inspection/modification (type, key, ref, and component name).
  The dive deeper than the root of the slotted content, the attributes approach will require additional code.
- provides more rendering control to the caller (although memoization of render results should be discouraged)
- introduces the problem of restricting the shape of the children to something than is supported by the layout and behavior of the component.
- feels more idomatic.
  Elements are defined in JSX, data is passed on attributes.

**The attributes approach**

- provides better slot discovery than props.children. The attributes are defined in the problems and can be documented with the component.
- introduces the challenge of where to apply props (root element or logically associated element).
- allows for render function pointers to be passed to the component. This lets the component control delayed or conditional rendering.
- is problematic for Storybook controls as the UI isn't designed to input complex JSX.

**Existing art**

- Per shift's comments on the RFC, the props.children approach appears more popular in other component libraries.
- List virtualization libraries most often have an items attribute that accepts a data array.
  The item template is defined as the singular child in react-window, but grouped item scenarios may require attributes to handle multiple templates.
- Modern tree virtualization flattens hierarchy to a single list with parent/child and depth tracking to allow list virtualization.

## Opinion

If it were all up to me, I would:

- use props.children for named slots
  - Components can restrict the children to a single element, a list, a limited hierarchy, or an opaque child/children.
  - Slots are used infrequently, so the expectation is that the developer will need to read documentation anyway (i.e. discovery isn't critical)
- use attributes for setting primitive values for the default slot content (e.g. <Field label="First Name" />)
- use attributes for items data in virtualized lists
- use props.children for group and item templates in virtualized lists

## Appendix: Challenges found with vNext attribute-slots

1. The type specification for ObjectShorthandProps requires the render function be specified as 'children' rather than a replacement for the entire props structure.
2. The resolveShorthandProps method returns an object with children when
   the slotted content is a primitive, array, or render function,
   but returns the props directly when the slotted content is a props object.
3. When using ObjectShorthandProps with a specific props type, components must specify the real component to instantiate in ComponentState.components.
   This requires a component to depend on the different concrete type instances of the slotted content components based on the props types.
   This causes extra if/then code to handle the different cases in the caller code.
4. If a component needs to inspect the resolved state of slotted content that is complex JSX, the same props.children navigation code will be required.

## Appendix: props.children format

This details the data shape of props.children depending on the slotted content.

### When children is a primitive

```ts
children: <value of primitive>
```

### When children is an HTML element

```ts
children: {
  $$typeof: Symbol(react.element)
  props: {
    children: <value within the element>
  }
  type: <element type (like div or label)>
}
```

### When children is a single component child

```ts
children: {
  $$typeof: Symbol(react.element)
  props: {
    children: <value within the component>
  }
  type: props => {...}
    displayName: <ComponentName>
    name: <ComponentName>
}
```

### When children is multiple HTML elements or components

```ts
children: [
  {
    $$typeof: Symbol(react.element),
    type: <element type (like div or label)>
    key: <value of key attribute>,
    ref: <reference if any>
    props: {
      children: <value within the element>
    }
  }
]
```
